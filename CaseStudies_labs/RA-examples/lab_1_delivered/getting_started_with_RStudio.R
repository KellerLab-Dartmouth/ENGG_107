# getting_started_with_RStudio.R

# If you're reading this in RStudio, that means you've successfully
# downloaded and installed both R and RStudio.  Congratulations!  
# 
# This text is in the SCRIPT window in RStudio.  This is where you
# will write your programs.  It works like a normal text editor.  
# You can save, open, and print your scripts from here; click
# on the word "File" on the menu bar above to see where these
# commands are.  
# 
# The window below this one is called the CONSOLE window.  You can 
# enter commands one by one there, just like in tryr.codeschool.com.  
# 
# The window to the upper right has two tabs, WORKSPACE and HISTORY.  
# You'll leave it on WORKSPACE most of the time.  When you create a
# variable, its name will appear in the WORKSPACE window.  
# Try it now: 
# 1) Move your cursor down to the Console window.  
# 2) Click on the white space in the window.  
# 3) Enter the name of a variable (any name; should not start with
# a number).  
# 4) Type the assignment symbol (<-), a less-than sign followed by a # dash.  
# 5) Type a number (any number).  
# 6) Press Enter.  
# 7) Look at the Workspace window to see your variable and its 
# value.  
# 
# The window to the lower right has four tabs, FILES, PLOTS, 
# PACKAGES, and HELP.  You can switch among the tabs by clicking
# on their names.  The tabs also switch automatically when you
# do something in the Script or Console windows that is related
# to their functions.  Try this: 
# 1) Move your cursor over the Console window and click, as before.  
# 2) Type help(seq) and press Enter.  The help file for the seq 
# command will appear in the Help window.  Study this help file
# for a moment.  
# 3) Now type plot(seq(1, 10, 1)) (note that there are TWO close 
# parentheses at the end of this command), and press Enter.  A plot
# appears.  Can you see why the plot looks the way it does?  Flip
# back to the help file if you need to.  
# 
# Your first program will be called hello_world.R.  
# 1) Click on File, on the menu bar above, then click on 
# New > R Script.  
# A new tab will appear, covering this one; you can get this tab 
# back by clicking on its name above.  
# 2) Save your new script with the name hello_world.R.  
# 3) In your new script, type the comment symbol (a pound sign, #), 
# followed by the script's file name.  
# 4) On the next line, type a comment symbol, then add your name and 
# e-mail address.  You will begin all your scripts for this class 
# with this information.  
# 5) Now create a blank line after your name and e-mail address.  
# 6) Type the command print("Hello, world!").  
# 7) Save your script (click File in the menu bar, then Save).  
# 8) Finally, run your script.  Click on the Run icon above.  
# What happens?
